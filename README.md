## 🎯 Why This Paper?
Anomaly detection is a core data mining technique for identifying rare, unusual patterns in data - critical for fraud detection, cybersecurity, healthcare monitoring, and system failures. This survey comprehensively reviews the evolution from traditional statistical methods to state-of-the-art deep learning approaches.

## 🔑 Key Contributions
1. **Comprehensive Taxonomy** - Categorizes methods into reconstruction-based (Autoencoders, VAEs, GANs) and prediction-based (RNNs, LSTMs, Transformers)
2. **180+ Methods Reviewed** - Covers traditional to cutting-edge deep learning techniques
3. **Hybrid Approaches** - Analyzes combining traditional + deep learning methods
4. **Real-World Applications** - Fraud detection, cybersecurity, healthcare, manufacturing, IoT

## 📊 Main Categories

### Reconstruction-Based Methods
- **Autoencoders (AE)** - Learn to reconstruct normal data; anomalies have high reconstruction error
- **Variational Autoencoders (VAE)** - Probabilistic approach with better generalization
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)** - Generator vs. Discriminator for complex distributions
- **Transformers** - Self-attention mechanisms for sequence anomalies

### Prediction-Based Methods
- **RNN/LSTM/GRU** - Predict next values in sequences; prediction errors indicate anomalies
- **Temporal Convolutional Networks** - 1D convolutions for time series
- **Attention Mechanisms** - Focus on relevant temporal patterns

## 🌍 Applications
- 💳 **Finance:** Credit card fraud detection ($28B annual fraud)
- 🔒 **Cybersecurity:** Network intrusion detection, zero-day attacks
- 🏥 **Healthcare:** Patient monitoring, medical image analysis
- 🏭 **Manufacturing:** Quality control, predictive maintenance
- 📱 **IoT:** Smart devices, system monitoring

## 🚧 Challenges
- Imbalanced data (anomalies are rare <1%)
- Lack of labeled anomalies
- Concept drift (normal behavior changes over time)
- Interpretability (explaining why something is anomalous)
- Real-time processing requirements
